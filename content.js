        "description": "Hey! Welcome to my website! I'm Tahiyat, I'm 23 years old and I grew up in Dhaka, Bangaladesh. Currently I live in Abu Dhabi, UAE. You might have caught me here on my website but If you lose me, you might find me screaming my lungs out in the podium. Or baking and decorating cakes for my baking side-hustle, stargazing at the beach, or the mountains or the countryside. If I am in the city you might catch me hovering around flower shops, or going for a late night drive around Saadiyat, or crafting up the perfect dipping sauce at your nearest hot-pot joint. If those don't work out you might find me hunting for discounted drug store makeup. But chances are you might also sit next to me on a plane to a random country you've probably never heard of. Or you might just catch me at my bedroom with a LuLuLun face-mask on doomscrolling cute cow reels."
