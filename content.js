        "description": "Welcome! I'm Tahiyat. If you're a close friend or family, you can use my 'dak-naam,' Fahia. I'm from Dhaka, but for now, I live in Abu Dhabi. You might have caught me here on my website but If you lose me, you might find me baking and decorating cakes for my baking side-hustle, stargazing at the beach, or the mountains or the countryside. If I am in the city you might catch me hovering around flower shops, or crafting up the perfect dipping sauce at your nearest hot-pot joint, or hunting for discounted drug-store makeup. But chances are you might also sit next to me on a plane to a random country you've probably never heard of. Or you might just catch me at my bedroom with a Lululun face-mask on doomscrolling cute cow reels."

        "description": "When I am not pondering about Development Economics, I am probably debating about it. I've spent the better half of my life screaming my lungs out on the podium. Debating gave me some of my closest friends, the ability to think critically that will stay with me for life, and some of my fondest memories. Even if I don't get to debate as much as I used to, I look back to going home late after practice sessions with my dad, and am grateful for all the opportunities it has given me. Opportunities neither me or my dad could have imagined at that time."
